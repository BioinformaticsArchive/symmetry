
* Also apply rotation to itself, i.e. P^k to generate new permutations, see Papula Uebungen, p. 16
* Try rotation group completion in a single pass?

* Rotation group: symmetry as Schoenflies and Herman-Mauguin symbol
* Assign rotation operator symbol to each rotation
* Check if axis are in plane or perpendicular
* Check if the number of axis match the point group

* In same cases distance threshold is very small (0.xx). Set to a minimum, i.e. 2 * rmsdThreshold, also, probably shouldn't be too large either because it
* slows down distance calculations.

* Use permutation group to store permutations in the solvers, rather than a separate hash map?
* 2 subunits, only two points for superposition!!, how to fix this??

* Try using refined axis angle (when found) and then loop over all angles,
that way solutions may be found earlier and speed up the calculation

* Separate prescreening into new class
* Use orbit calculation to find local quaternary symmetry

* If all chains are identical, calculate RMSD

* consider changing GTS score to distance max 4.
* Try LGA score instead of GTS ?:

GTS may be appropriate, since there will be no significant local
differences between the subunits.
